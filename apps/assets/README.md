# Assets Page

This repo contains the front-end for the assets page: [https://assets.evmos.org/](https://assets.evmos.org/).

## Requirements

- Node v18.12.0+

## Current implementation

It uses the [dashboard-backend](https://github.com/tharsis/dashboard-backend) to fetch the information and to create the transactions.

The wallet extensions code is inside the `wallet` folders in `src/internal` and `src/components`, after releasing the v1 of the assets page, the wallet code must be moved to the `react-components` repo created in the `evmos` org in github.

## Run

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tharsis/assetsPage
cd assetsPage
yarn install
yarn build
yarn run dev
```

## Configuration

The endpoints used by default are currently stored in `src/internal/wallet/functionality/networkConfig.ts`

It's using the default values that should work for most of the cases, but most of the methods that consume the endpoints can overwrite the configuration with optional parameters.

## Tests

The tests can be run using:

```sh
yarn run test
```

## Registering a new chain or token

Showing up on this list of Assets means that the app supports the technical functionalities of interacting with this chain / asset / token (sending, receiving, automatic conversions from ERC-20 to IBC and vice versa).

In order to get on this list, this is the following process:

1. Create a PR in our Chain Token Registry [repository](https://github.com/evmos/chain-token-registry/).

2. Fill out the parameters as indicated in the PR, one of which includes submitting and ERC-20 address.
    1. Note: if there is no ERC-20 representation of the token, it is necessary to submit a governance proposal to register the token.
    For more information on how to register a token please visit evmos [docs](https://docs.evmos.org/protocol/modules/erc20#registercoinproposal)

3. Once the PR is submitted, our internal team (typically Full-Stack) will manually review the PR.

4. Full-Stack will approve the PR once all parameters are filled out correctly.

5. It takes 24 hours to get the token to show up on our Assets list because the existing cache needs to be updated - in cases of absolute urgency, we can also manually refresh the cache to show the token in a few seconds.
